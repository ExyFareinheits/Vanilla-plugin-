## Key Features

- **Axe Tree Chopping:** Chop down entire trees by breaking a log with an axe while holding SHIFT. The number of hits depends on the axe type. Visual particles and sounds provide feedback.
- **Fishing Net:** Craft and throw nets into water to catch fish and rare loot. Progress is shown with a hologram. Retrieve the net early with SHIFT + right-click.
- **Fish Drying Rack:** Build racks with tripwire to dry fish or poppy (for tobacco). Collect dried products after a set time.
- **Sand Sieve:** Construct a sieve with scaffolding and trapdoors. Right-click with sand or gravel to filter and receive random drops.
- **Birch Sap Collection:** Place a tripwire hook on a birch log to collect sap. After a delay, collect sap with a bottle and drink for random effects.
- **Stonecutter Expansion:** Use the stonecutter to convert logs to sticks, wool to string, and ice to snowballs. Sharpen tools for durability and a chance to enchant, with cooldowns and break chance.
- **Custom Items & Recipes:** Includes Stone Stick, Miner Shield, Super Torch, Pouch of Dust, XP Book, Super Bonemeal, Tobacco, Cigarette, Pocket Torch, and more—each with unique names, lore, and models.
- **Other Mechanics:** Use flint on stone to create sparks and possibly fire. Custom bonemeal affects a 3x3 area. Cigarettes and energy drinks provide effects.
